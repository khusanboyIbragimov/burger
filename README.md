#Eat Da Burger!


### Overview
A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat... and then devour them!
Please check out the launched app on Heroku [here](https://guarded-springs-49861.herokuapp.com/)!


## Description on how to use the app
The burger app allows the user to add a type of burger using a form and submit button. The burger then shows up to the left of the page with a "Eat me" button, allowing the user to eat the burger. The eaten burger then moves to the right of the page.

## Requirements
Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. Use Node and Sequelize to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

*This app is similar to the burger app, but it has been sequelized
